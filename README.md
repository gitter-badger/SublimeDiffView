*Git and SVN Diff Viewer for Sublime Text 3*  
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CJTozer/SublimeDiffView.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/CJTozer/SublimeDiffView)

## Features
* Side-by-side view with differences highlighted
* Quick navigation from one change to the next, or search for diffs in a specific file
* Auto-detects the repository to use from the current active file
* Flexible diffs for both Git and SVN (see below for the full set of options)
* The most common diff (uncommitted changes) is the quickest to use

## Installation

1. Install the Sublime Text [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) plugin if you don't have it already
2. Open the command palette and start typing `Package Control: Install Package`

* `Alt + Shift + D` to run a diff
    * Enter the diff to run, and hit enter
        * *See below for supported diff options*
    * This lists all the changes, and shows you a preview as you move down the list
    * You can search for a particular file in the list of changes, which will filter the results
    * Hit `Enter` to jump to the currently selected change
    * hit `Esc` to cancel the DiffView, and return to where you were
* `Alt + D` to review the last diff
    * This will show the list of changes from the last diff, starting from the last change you previewed
